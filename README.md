## Description

Simply put, this is **web-application to generate icons**. By uploading an image of your choice, you can generate an icon-like image. The generated images are assumed to be rounded squares and circles. The reason for this is that the former is often used as for desktop applications and the latter is often used for SNS profiles.

## Motivation

My aim of developing this application is to learn about these technologies.
