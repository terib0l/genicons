# genicons

##### Ongoing
##### The project is expected to be completed by March 2022.

## Description

This is generating icons app.  
By uploading an image of your choice, you can generate an icon-like image.  
The generated images are assumed to be rounded squares and circles.  
The reason for this is that the former is often used as an icon for desktop applications, and the latter is often used for profiles.

## Motivation

The aim of developing this application is to learn about these technologies.  
***[SQL, ML, AWS, DevSecOps, Docker + IaC, (and TDD)]***  
I'll Create Web API using FastAPI with SQL and ML and dockerize it.  
For the front end, I'll use Vue.js as it is easy to develop SPA.  
Then deploy this app on AWS.  
To study DevSecOps, I'll also use GihubActions to create a workflow that incorporates security checks.
